A Walk in the park... Or so it seems
You feel tired after sitting at home for the entire day due to online classes. 
So you decide to go take a walk in the park. The park is very large, and there are many parts you can visit. You first walk over to:
You walk over to the playground
You keep on walking, you just want to stretch your legs.
You feel like you want to explore someplace you have never 
been before, so you venture to the woods
You feel a drop of rain on your face, it is better to go home and
get an umbrella.

The playground is deserted:
You head back where you came from
You notice a piece of note on the ground and pick it up.
The note reads:
In the haunted forest, there lies a magical secret...
You head to the haunted forest...
This note must be some kid fooling around, theres nothing in the
forest and you should just leave the paper on the ground
You look up, there— a sign reading “Playground closed do to coronavius” You head back to where you came from
The moment you take a step, thunder breaks out, and you
knew that you should have went home to get your umbrella
You dash home for cover
You head towards those trees 
hoping that you wont get wet
Who cares about getting a little 
wet anyways! Just keep taking 
your relxing walk

You feel a buzz in your pocket. It was your phone— you check your phone
You look at your phone, there— was a weather warning. It read: 
“Warning! Severe rain and dangerous winds expected!”
You go home for cover
You walk around like a fool, who 
cares about some rain and wind?
In an instant, a bolt of lightning came
 down from the sky and you die
Those weather reports are never accurate! 
You think to yourself. Just keep walking...
You haven’t walked for 30 seconds, and you hear a
deafening crash and you see a distant lightning bolt
You look left, and right. The only thing that can
keep you dry from the rain are those trees
You remember that you haven’t taken a shower in 
over 4 years. This rain will clean you up real good!
There is a park gazebo not too far from here... maybe 
you can sprint there to wait for the rain to pass...
Under the roof, you sit and wait for the rain to pass... 
You hear distant rumbles of lightning, and the wind
 is blowing through your hair
After sitting for a while, you decide to check your phone.
You keep 
waiting...
This rain never seems to end... 
Maybe you should head home.
You arrive at the woods. you look around...
This place looks haunted. 
The rain starts pouring... You dont want to 
get wet, so you stay in the same place
unbeknownst to you... behind you there was a 
bear, it was too late, and the bear had killed you
You look down, and to your 
surprise, you see bear prints. 
You decide to follow them.
These prints lead to a concealed cave.
In the cave you see glowing rocks.
You walk in the cave to explore. 
No one has been here for years...
To your horror... At the mouth of the cave, came 
a bone chilling roar, and the bear charged at you...
The bear might come back at any second! 
So you decide to go back to the safety of your home.
There is a rustle above your head... Some kuind of animal is moving 
about ontop of you, so you decide to climb up the tree and check
You climb onto the tree to find a squirrel on the top. Could the squirrel have made that sound?
You decide to climb higher to find out...
You stumble and fall, in a few days, you wake up in a hospital bed
At last, you have reached your front door... You reach in your
pocket, but to your dismay, your keys are missing
You go back to the park to search for the 
key, maybe you dropped it somewhere
You try to pry open a 
hwindow to get in.
Just as you started prying the window,
you hear a siren behind you.
It was a police officer.
You explain to the officer that you 
are locked out of your home
You keep on prying...
After a while the nice officer gets you in your
cozy home... Wow that was an adventure.
The officer saw you trying to break into a house. Despite
saying that this was your own house, they arrest you.
You look around to see if a window or door is unlocked
To your surprise, the backyard door was unlocked,
and you walk into your cozy home.
What an adventure you had
That must have been a squirrel, 
so you decide to climb down the tree
