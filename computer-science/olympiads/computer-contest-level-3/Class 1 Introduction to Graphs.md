> In Mathematics, we have the problem of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg.

**Try to find a path that would cross each bridge once and only once.**

We cannot cross every bridge only once.

## Euler's Analysis

- During any walk in the graph, the
number of times one enters a non- terminal vertex equals the number of
times one leaves it.
